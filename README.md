# Advent of Code 2023

I'm taking part in the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) this year, and this repository has my solutions to the various problems.

## Why

I will once again bev using it as an opportunity to play around with [Go](https://golang.org/), so expect somewhat scrappy code within.

## How to use this project

* Build `bash make build`
* Test `bash make test`
* Run `./bin/aoc -day 1` where X is the day (e.g. 4) and Y optionally is the input file location (./day4/input.txt)
```bash
./bin/aoc -day 4 
```
